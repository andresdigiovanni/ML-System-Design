# **3. Problem Definition**

Defining the machine learning problem precisely is a foundational step. A well-scoped problem statement allows you to choose the appropriate model, collect the right data, and evaluate performance meaningfully.

---

## **3.1 Understand the Business Context**

Before modeling, make sure you understand:

- **Why** this problem is being solved.
- **Who** will use the predictions (e.g., internal systems, end-users, analysts).
- **What decisions** will be made using the model’s output.
- **What the cost** of false positives and false negatives is.

Examples:
- In a fraud detection system, false positives may inconvenience users, while false negatives may cause financial loss.
- In a content recommendation engine, low relevance might reduce engagement, but incorrect predictions may have minimal consequences.

This understanding influences:
- The choice of model architecture
- The loss function
- Evaluation metrics
- Post-processing steps

## **3.2 Define the ML Task Type**

Clearly determine the **type of problem** you're solving:

| Task Type             | Example Use Case                     | Output Type         |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Binary Classification | Fraud detection                     | Yes / No            |
| Multiclass Classification | Document classification       | Class label          |
| Regression            | Price prediction                     | Real number          |
| Ranking               | Search or recommendation results     | Ordered list         |
| Clustering            | Customer segmentation (unsupervised) | Cluster ID (latent)  |
| Forecasting           | Demand prediction (time series)      | Value per time step  |
| Generative Modeling   | Text/image generation                | Raw/generated data   |

Also identify if this is a **supervised**, **unsupervised**, or **reinforcement learning** problem.

## **3.3 Define the Target Variable**

Clearly specify what the model is trying to predict:

- **Explicit labels**: Purchase made (yes/no), churned (yes/no)
- **Implicit labels**: Based on derived behavior (e.g., repeated visits → high interest)

If the label must be constructed:
- Define the time window for outcomes.
- Make sure labeling logic reflects the business intent.

> *Incorrect or noisy labels can drastically harm model performance.*

---

## **3.4 Clarify Evaluation Strategy**

Your success criteria should be **quantitative**, not just subjective.

- Offline metrics: accuracy, precision/recall, ROC-AUC, log loss, MSE, etc.
- Online metrics: conversion rate, revenue impact, latency
- Business metrics: revenue lift, cost reduction, user engagement

Also define:
- Acceptable **baseline performance** (e.g., using heuristics or random predictions)
- Thresholds for **model success**
- Metrics that will be used **post-deployment**

> *Ensure stakeholders agree on what “good” means before modeling begins.*

---

## **3.5 Identify Trade-offs**

Every ML system involves trade-offs. Make these explicit:

- Accuracy vs. latency
- Precision vs. recall
- Interpretability vs. complexity
- Automation vs. manual override
- Short-term vs. long-term goals

Discuss these openly with product and business stakeholders.

---

By the end of this stage, you should have a **formal problem statement** that includes:

- Problem description (in business and ML terms)
- Target variable and label source
- ML task type
- Evaluation criteria
- Constraints and trade-offs
