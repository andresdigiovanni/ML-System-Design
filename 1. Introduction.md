# **1. Introduction**

## **1.1 What is a Machine Learning System?**

A Machine Learning (ML) system is a software architecture that automates decision-making or prediction tasks using data-driven algorithms. It leverages historical data to learn patterns and relationships, which can then be applied to unseen inputs to infer outcomes, classify information, generate content, or make recommendations.

An ML system is more than just a trained model; it involves:

- **Data pipelines** that collect, clean, and process data.
- **Model development** including training, tuning, and evaluation.
- **Infrastructure** to deploy and serve predictions at scale.
- **Monitoring components** to ensure performance and reliability in production.
- **Automation and CI/CD pipelines** that enable rapid iteration and continuous learning.

Modern ML systems must be designed for real-world use cases, with robustness, scalability, observability, and maintainability in mind.

## **1.4 Overview of the Machine Learning Lifecycle**

A production-ready ML system typically follows this lifecycle:

1. **Problem Framing**  
   Define the business objective, ML task type (e.g., classification, regression), and evaluation metrics.

2. **Data Collection & Exploration**  
   Ingest, analyze, and understand the data. Identify target variables, assess quality, and plan preprocessing.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   Create, clean, transform, and select features that will be input to the model.

4. **Model Selection & Training**  
   Choose the algorithm(s), train with historical data, and tune hyperparameters.

5. **Evaluation & Validation**  
   Assess the model using validation data and ensure it meets both offline and online performance criteria.

6. **Deployment**  
   Package and deploy the model for inference in production (real-time or batch).

7. **Monitoring & Maintenance**  
   Track metrics like latency, accuracy, and data drift. Trigger retraining and issue alerts when anomalies are detected.

8. **Iteration & Improvement**  
   Continuously improve models through re-training, better features, and feedback loops.
