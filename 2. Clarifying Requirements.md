# **2. Clarifying Requirements**

Before diving into data, models, or infrastructure, it's critical to clearly define the **problem**, its **constraints**, and the **expectations** of the system. Misunderstood requirements are one of the most common reasons ML projects fail, especially when transitioning from research to production.

This section outlines how to align stakeholders, define system boundaries, and identify key constraints before design begins.

## **2.1 Reframing the Problem**

Start by restating the problem in your own words to ensure mutual understanding with stakeholders, such as product managers, domain experts, or clients.

Ask:
- **"What are we trying to predict or recommend?"**
- **"What action or decision will be taken based on the model's output?"**
- **"What does success look like?"**

Often, business problems can be reframed in ML-friendly terms:
- Increasing click-through rates → binary classification
- Reducing churn → probability estimation
- Optimizing prices → regression or reinforcement learning

Reframing clarifies the **ML task type**, **target variable**, and potential **evaluation strategy**.

## **2.2 Key Questions to Define Scope**

To design an effective system, clarify the following:

### ✅ **Data Availability**
- How much historical data is available?
- What types of data can we use (structured, images, text, time series)?
- Are labels available or must they be inferred?

> *If data is limited, simpler models may generalize better. If data is abundant, deep learning or ensemble methods may be more suitable.*

---

### ✅ **Hardware and Time Constraints**
- How long do we have to build and deliver the model?
- What computing resources are available (CPU/GPU, cloud/on-prem, edge devices)?
- Are there real-time latency requirements?

> *Low-latency systems may favor smaller, optimized models; high-compute availability opens the door to more complex architectures.*

---

### ✅ **Accuracy vs. Speed Trade-offs**
- Is prediction **speed** more critical than **accuracy** (e.g., real-time user interaction)?
- Is there tolerance for approximate predictions?

> *Understand where performance bottlenecks exist and how tolerant the application is to model complexity.*

---

### ✅ **Retraining Requirements**
- Does the system need to **adapt** over time?
- How often should the model be retrained (daily, weekly, triggered by drift)?

> *This affects architecture decisions like data versioning, retraining automation, and pipeline scheduling.*

---

### ✅ **Legal, Ethical, and Privacy Considerations**
- Are there regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) affecting data usage?
- Do we need to anonymize or encrypt sensitive information?
- Are there biases that could lead to harmful or unfair outcomes?

> *Early identification of risks prevents compliance issues later and ensures ethical AI practices.*

---

## **2.3 Document and Align with Stakeholders**

Create a **requirements specification document** summarizing:
- Business goal and ML framing
- Target users and use cases
- Constraints and assumptions
- Key metrics and success thresholds
- Deployment and retraining plans

Review it with stakeholders to ensure shared understanding. This document becomes the foundation for system design and experimentation, and reduces miscommunication as the project evolves.
