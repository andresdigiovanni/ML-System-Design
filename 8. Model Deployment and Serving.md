# **8. Model Deployment and Serving**

Deploying a model is more than just exporting a `.pkl` or `.pt` file â€” it's about making it robust, scalable, observable, and maintainable in production. This section covers the architecture, strategies, and tooling necessary to serve models reliably.

## **8.1 Deployment Strategies**

### ðŸ”¹ **Batch vs. Online Inference**
| Type           | Description                                      | Example Use Cases              |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Batch**      | Run inference periodically on large data chunks  | Daily credit scoring, analytics |
| **Online**     | Real-time predictions via API                    | Chatbots, personalization, fraud detection |

### ðŸ”¹ **Deployment Targets**
- **Cloud Services**: AWS SageMaker, GCP Vertex AI, Azure ML
- **Containers**: Docker + Kubernetes (K8s), kserve
- **Edge Devices**: Mobile phones, IoT (e.g., TensorFlow Lite, ONNX)
- **Serverless**: AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions (for lightweight models)

---

## **8.2 Model Packaging and Versioning**

### ðŸ”¹ **Model Serialization**
- Standard formats: `joblib`, `pickle`, `ONNX`, `SavedModel` (TensorFlow), `TorchScript`
- Containerized models for portability and reproducibility

### ðŸ”¹ **Model Versioning**
- Track multiple versions of a model and associated metadata (input schema, metrics, environment)
- Tools: MLflow Model Registry, DVC, Seldon Core, BentoML

> *Model versioning ensures rollback and comparison between iterations.*

---

## **8.3 Inference Architecture**

### ðŸ”¹ **Model API**
- REST/gRPC endpoints for serving predictions
- Include health checks, input validation, and timeout handling

### ðŸ”¹ **Inference Pipeline**
- Preprocessing: Feature transformation on-the-fly (align with training)
- Model inference: Call to loaded model
- Postprocessing: Output formatting, thresholding, enrichment

### ðŸ”¹ **Optimizing for Latency**
- Reduce input data size
- Use model quantization, pruning, or distillation
- GPU/TPU acceleration
- Async inference or batching for throughput

---

## **8.4 A/B Testing and Shadow Deployment**

### ðŸ”¹ **A/B Testing**
- Deploy multiple model versions to compare performance with live traffic
- Track key online metrics (e.g., click-through rate, conversion)

### ðŸ”¹ **Shadow Deployment**
- Route a copy of real user traffic to a new model without affecting user experience
- Use for sanity checks and measuring divergence from current production

---

## **8.5 Monitoring and Logging**

Deployment is just the beginning â€” continuous monitoring ensures the model stays reliable over time.

### ðŸ”¹ **Key Things to Monitor**
| Category               | What to Track                                   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Performance**        | Latency, throughput, availability               |
| **Model Health**       | Prediction confidence, distribution drift       |
| **Data Drift**         | Change in input feature distributions over time |
| **Concept Drift**      | Change in relationship between inputs and target|
| **Business Metrics**   | Clicks, conversions, engagement                 |

### ðŸ”¹ **Tools**
- Prometheus + Grafana (metrics)
- OpenTelemetry, ELK Stack (logs)
- WhyLabs, Arize AI, Evidently AI (ML-specific drift detection)

> *Monitoring is non-negotiable. A high-performing model can silently degrade if not observed.*

---

## **8.6 CI/CD for ML Models (MLOps)**

Automating the deployment pipeline allows you to ship faster and with confidence.

### ðŸ”¹ **CI/CD Components**
- **Continuous Integration**: Test model logic, validate data and schema, run unit tests
- **Continuous Deployment**: Auto-deploy models if tests pass

### ðŸ”¹ **Tools and Frameworks**
- GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins
- Terraform, Helm (for infrastructure)
- ML-specific: Kubeflow Pipelines, Metaflow, TFX, ZenML

---

## **8.7 Security and Compliance**

### ðŸ”¹ **Security Practices**
- Secure endpoints (OAuth, API tokens)
- Rate limiting and DoS protection
- Isolate inference environments with Docker/VMs

### ðŸ”¹ **Data Privacy and Governance**
- Ensure PII is anonymized or encrypted
- GDPR / HIPAA compliance where applicable
- Log access and activity

---

## **8.8 Retraining and Feedback Loops**

### ðŸ”¹ **Monitoring Model Degradation**
- Use monitoring tools to detect drift
- Alert on underperforming segments

### ðŸ”¹ **Retraining Strategy**
- Manual or scheduled retraining (e.g., daily, weekly)
- Trigger retraining based on performance thresholds
- Continuously integrate fresh data from production

### ðŸ”¹ **Active Learning**
- Use low-confidence predictions to select samples for labeling
- Human-in-the-loop retraining

---

## **8.9 Best Practices**

- Design for rollback: Every deployment should be reversible
- Use canary deployments or traffic splitting
- Keep training and inference environments consistent (e.g., use Docker)
- Treat models as software: version, test, document, monitor
