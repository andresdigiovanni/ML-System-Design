# **5. System Architecture Design**

Designing the architecture of an ML system involves defining all the components and how they interact â€” from data ingestion and feature engineering to training, deployment, and monitoring.

This section outlines the architectural components and best practices for building scalable, maintainable, and production-ready ML systems.

## **5.1 Data Pipeline Architecture**

Data is the foundation of any ML system. A robust pipeline ensures consistent, clean, and timely delivery of data to the model.

### ðŸ”¹ **Target Variable (Label) Definition**
- Explicit labels (e.g., transactions, churn events)
- Implicit labels (e.g., clicks, engagement signals)
- Clear timestamp alignment: label must not leak future information

### ðŸ”¹ **Feature Engineering**
- **Raw feature sources**: user logs, product metadata, clickstreams, IoT sensors
- **Transformations**:
  - Handling nulls / outliers
  - Binning, normalization, encoding
  - Aggregations (e.g., time windows, user-level summaries)
- **Feature selection**:
  - Filter-based (correlation, mutual info)
  - Model-based (feature importance, L1 regularization)
- **Temporal validation**: features must only use past data relative to the prediction timestamp

### ðŸ”¹ **Bias, Fairness & Privacy Considerations**
- Audit for data imbalance or sampling bias
- Remove sensitive features if required (e.g., race, gender)
- Ensure GDPR/CCPA compliance where necessary (e.g., right to be forgotten, data anonymization)

### ðŸ”¹ **Data Infrastructure**
- **Storage**: cloud object storage (e.g., S3, GCS), data lakes, feature stores (e.g., Feast, Tecton)
- **Streaming & ingestion**: Kafka, Kinesis
- **ETL orchestration**: Apache Airflow, Dagster, Prefect

## **5.2 Model Development Architecture**

### ðŸ”¹ **Baseline Modeling**
- Start with heuristics or business rules for comparison
- Simple models: logistic regression, decision trees
- Establish a benchmark before adding complexity

### ðŸ”¹ **Advanced Modeling**
- Tree-based models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Deep learning models (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, transformers)
- Multimodal models (e.g., text + image)

### ðŸ”¹ **Model Selection**
- Match model complexity to data size and problem scope
- Use cross-validation, time-series validation where appropriate

### ðŸ”¹ **Reproducibility & Experiment Tracking**
- Use ML experiment tracking tools:
  - **MLflow**, **Weights & Biases**, **Neptune.ai**
- Log:
  - Parameters and hyperparameters
  - Model artifacts
  - Dataset versions
  - Evaluation results

### ðŸ”¹ **Hyperparameter Optimization**
- Manual grid/random search â†’ Scikit-learn, Optuna
- Distributed tuning â†’ Ray Tune, Vizier, HyperOpt

### ðŸ”¹ **Model Versioning**
- Model registry tools (MLflow, Sagemaker Model Registry)
- Track inputs, outputs, and metadata

---

## **5.3 Training Infrastructure (MLOps)**

- On-prem vs. cloud (e.g., AWS SageMaker, GCP Vertex AI, Azure ML)
- Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Scalable training jobs (Spark MLlib, Ray, Horovod)
- Scheduled training jobs (Airflow, Kubeflow Pipelines)
- CI/CD for ML (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI + ML tools)

---

## **5.4 Model Deployment Architecture**

### ðŸ”¹ **Deployment Modes**
| Mode         | Use Case                    | Tools                            |
|--------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Batch        | Periodic scoring, large volumes | Apache Spark, Airflow, dbt      |
| Real-time    | Low-latency predictions      | FastAPI, TensorFlow Serving, Triton |
| Edge / On-device | Offline predictions       | TensorFlow Lite, ONNX, Core ML  |

### ðŸ”¹ **Serving Infrastructure**
- Load balancing and autoscaling
- REST/GRPC APIs for inference
- Feature consistency between training and serving
- Model caching and warming

---

## **5.5 Monitoring and Observability**

- **Input data drift detection**
- **Model performance monitoring** (accuracy, latency, throughput)
- **Alerting and logging**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack
- **Canary releases and rollback strategies**

---

## **5.6 Modularity and Extensibility**

- Build pipelines as reusable components:
  - `data_preprocessor.py`
  - `train_model.py`
  - `predict.py`
  - `evaluate.py`
- Favor loosely coupled, testable, plug-and-play components
- Version everything: data, code, models, configs
